I am Ajith Kumar Challa, a first year graduate student at CU-ICAR specializing in Autonomous vehicles and particularly interested in motion planning and control of autonomous vehicles.

I have 3 years experience in Formula student handling vehicle dynamics and 6 months experience in a startup company in which I had dealt with the testing of hydraulic powertrain and air suspension systems of a cargo handling vehicle. 

This repository contains my submissions of the assignments and projects from the course AuE8930 Autonomous Science and Systems.
